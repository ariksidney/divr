# Divr

A very basic, web-only diving app for logging my personal dives. Based on Angular and Firebase. Hacked together over the last few years :-)

# Why?

The application for my Mares dive computer looks like from the 90s and is quite complicated. I wanted an easy way of visualizing and logging my dives. Unfortunately another application is still required to import the dives from the watch, but I might find a way around it in the future.

# Features

Just export a XML file from [Subsurface](https://subsurface-divelog.org/)  and upload it to Divr.

Currently supports:

* Gas type: Air
* Divesites
* Waypoints
* Temperatures


Other features like buddies, dive plannings, other gases, free or technical diving etc. are not supported.

**Since Mares DiversDiary for Mac seems to be not available anymore, the latest version only works with Subsurface XML exports**
